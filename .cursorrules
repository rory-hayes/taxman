# Cursor Rules for the Financial Dashboard & Tax Assistant

## Overview
These rules guide the development of the application based on the Supastarter boilerplate to ensure consistent coding practices, efficient development, and a seamless user experience.

## References
- Refer to `projectdescription.md` for a detailed outline of the project scope and milestones.
- Maintain comprehensive and up-to-date documentation in `documentation.md` to ensure clarity and consistency throughout the project lifecycle.
- Use the **Supastarter boilerplate** as the foundation for development.

## Rules

### 1. **Code Context**
- Analyze and summarize all boilerplate files to understand their purpose and functionality before making modifications.
- Identify reusable components and existing integrations to minimize redundant work and maintain consistency.

### 2. **Authentication**
- Customize the Supabase authentication system to include:
  - Email/password and Gmail OAuth options.
  - Onboarding steps to collect user data, including age range, location, job field, savings goals, payday date, and optional bank account details.

### 3. **Dashboard**
- Revise the existing dashboard to include:
  - Widgets displaying key metrics (e.g., total salary, taxes paid, take-home pay, and savings goals).
  - Responsive design implemented with Tailwind CSS.
  - Interactive and dynamic charts created using Chart.js or Recharts.

### 4. **OCR & AI Integration**
- Implement Tesseract for OCR functionality to extract data from payslips and bank statements.
- Leverage the OpenAI API to generate personalized insights and recommendations based on user data.

### 5. **Data Privacy**
- Encrypt all sensitive user data and ensure secure storage and retrieval using Supabase.
- Adhere to GDPR/CCPA compliance requirements in all aspects of data handling and processing.

### 6. **Documentation**
- Keep a detailed and regularly updated `documentation.md` file that:
  - Explains changes made to the boilerplate.
  - Tracks implemented features, issues, and resolutions.
  - Provides clear instructions for deployment, testing, and further iterations.

### 7. **Testing**
- Conduct thorough testing for all backend and frontend features, including:
  - Unit tests for API endpoints and core logic.
  - Integration tests for component interactions.
  - UI testing to ensure compatibility across desktop and mobile environments.

### 8. **Deployment**
- Prepare the application for:
  - Local hosting during the development phase.
  - Deployment to Visualiser for user testing and feedback collection.
- Ensure that the deployment process is well-documented in `documentation.md` for seamless replication and scalability.

### 9. **Database Schema Guidelines**

#### Table Naming & Structure
- Use snake_case for all database objects (tables, columns, functions)
- All tables must have:
  - `id uuid primary key`
  - `created_at timestamptz`
  - `updated_at timestamptz` (where applicable)
  - `user_id` foreign key for user-specific data

#### Core Tables
1. **user_profiles**
   - Central user information storage
   - Contains onboarding and preference data
   - Required fields: email, age_range, location, job_field

2. **payslips**
   - Stores payslip data and OCR results
   - Maintains monthly salary information
   - Links to physical files in storage

3. **tax_records**
   - Annual tax summaries
   - Tracks cumulative financial data
   - Used for tax projections and analysis

#### Financial Tables
4. **savings_goals**
   - Personal and shared savings targets
   - Progress tracking
   - Partner collaboration support

5. **bank_statements**
   - Bank statement storage and processing
   - OCR data extraction results
   - Transaction categorization

6. **transactions**
   - Individual financial transactions
   - Category-based organization
   - Income/expense tracking

#### Support Tables
7. **notifications**
   - System notifications
   - Email reminders
   - User alerts

#### Security Requirements
- Enable Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- Implement appropriate access policies
- Encrypt sensitive data in jsonb fields
- Use secure storage buckets for files

#### Performance Considerations
- Maintain indexes on frequently queried columns
- Use appropriate data types for columns
- Consider partitioning for large tables
- Implement efficient query patterns
